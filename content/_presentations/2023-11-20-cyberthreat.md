title: "Behind the Scenes: A Look at Iran's Contracting Landscape"
---
Both of the main security agencies in Iran - the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Ministry of Intelligence and
Security - use private companies and individual contractors for malware development, operational activity, and
support/training.[expand]
Using recent and historical examples, we will discuss how researchers have linked companies and
individuals back to threat groups (and security agencies) through OSINT and technical links, and outline the types of
services contractors likely provide to Iran's government. These are comprised of a range of different activities, including
espionage, cyber-enabled influence, and disruptive operations.
This talk identifies ongoing trends and remaining areas of uncertainty when it comes to Iran's contracting landscape,
including contractors' remits, tactics, and relationships to the government. We explore questions about the talent pools
used to build Iran's contractors, the comparisons with other countries' contracting models, how Western sanctions and
indictments have addressed these third-party companies and how theyâ€™ve informed the UK and US's policies towards Iran.
