title: "An APT's Revenge: How Attackers Respond to Disclosure"
---
Government and industry have invested significant effort in understanding the threat landscape in order to defend their interests in cyberspace, but the issue of how defensive action can influence attacker behaviour is poorly understood. [expand]
This presentation seeks to explore the question: how do attackers respond to investigation into their operations? We will review the ‘spectrum’ of response options and changes that attackers have made to their operations following incident response cases and public reporting (and attribution) of specific groups. Responses range from defensive (‘go quiet’) to aggressive (threats or targeting of researchers), and include a multitude of change-ups in tactics, techniques, and procedures in between. This analysis will draw on evidence from numerous examples both from our investigations and cases from open sources to cover high priority threat groups faced by the public and private sectors as well as unintended consequences of disclosure and thoughts from a defender perspective.
