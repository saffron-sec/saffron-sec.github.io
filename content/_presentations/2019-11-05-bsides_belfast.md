From the earlier iterations of cybercriminal attacks to the SWIFT bank heists, attacks on payment systems have persisted and evolved.[expand]
The SWIFT attacks represent a new degree of sophistication, and the TTPs behind them show ingenuity on the part of the attackers. Since 2016, the state-sponsored threat actor, Lazarus, has compromised several banks and used the SWIFT network to steal millions – at a rate of one attack per month over recent months. How has the group been so successful? What is their mode of operation – from reconnaissance to execution? Lazarus’ tools continue to evolve and demonstrate an adaptive and creative capability. The group’s targeting potentially suggests a political agenda, showing a new face of state-sponsored activity in cybercrime. Yet what are we missing? From infection vectors to money laundering, some aspects of the SWIFT bank heists remain a mystery. This presentation will cover a brief overview in the evolution of cybercrime, a look at some key SWIFT cases, the nuances and developments in Lazarus activity, and the multiple unknowns of the group’s operations (and potential theories).
