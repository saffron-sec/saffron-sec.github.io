The risk-reward calculation of an attack on an institutionâ€™s payment system nets a huge payoff if successful.[expand] 
Over the last few years, these attacks have become more commonplace and seem to be constantly evolving. The intrusions demonstrate advanced technical skills and creative methods of cashing out. The attacks show again how attackers are investing in being able to manipulate parts of the banking system with the regular appearance of new malware, and increasingly seem to be co-ordinating with other criminals, particularly when it comes to the post-intrusion cashout. This presentation will cover heists seen in 2018 and 2019, details of the newest malware used by the attackers, trends in tooling and techniques, further evidence of the potential nature of their relationship with other criminal groups, and what might come under attack next.
