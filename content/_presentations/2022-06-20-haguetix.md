title: "A Year in the Life: An Iranian Group’s Road to Fame"
---
DireFate, an Iranian actor also known as DEV-0270 and Nemesis Kitten (and likely part of Charming Kitten/PHOSPHORUS) was first seen in 2021 with activity ranging from vulnerability scanning to disruption along with global, opportunistic targeting but with a likely focus on the US and Israel.[expand]
Over the year, DireFate made several opsec mistakes, leading to several insights into the actor and its operations. This talk will trace DireFate’s activities from its appearance in 2021 into 2022, covering the group’s campaigns, malware, and victims. The group’s activities will then be contextualized within larger trends in targeting and tactics recently seen among Iranian actors.
