The Janne Nolan Prize competition for the best article on national security/international affairs is hosted by the Future Strategy Forum, an initiative that connects scholars who research national security with leading practitioners and elevates female talent in the field. The competition offers prizes to the best new scholarship from early career scholars in national and international security.

The manuscript written by Naumaan is eligible to be workshopped by a group of senior scholars. Naumaan will also submit her manuscript to Texas National Security Review and upon completing a double-blind peer review process, her work will be eligible to be published in a special issue released summer 2021.
