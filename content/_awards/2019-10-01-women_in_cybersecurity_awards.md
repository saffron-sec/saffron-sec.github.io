Saher Naumaan, Threat Intelligence Analyst at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence, took home the honours in the Newcomer Award, recognised for her impressive impact in the industry despite the short time sheâ€™s been participating in it. Saher has built an excellent reputation through her research of state-sponsored cyber espionage, with a focus on threat groups and activity in the Middle East. Recognition of the outstanding impact she has made in co-founding the RESET conference, one of the most well-known security conferences in the UK, was also an important part of her win.
